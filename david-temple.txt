Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline elements are within a line versus block elements create a new line. E.g. inline elements would be used if you wanted to italicize one word in a sentence.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    Absolutely positioned elements dont' flow or flex like other elements, so other elements may go behind or in front of the absolutely positioned element as the responsive page design scale
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
    You could do the width: auto with a max-width so that it's no larger than the max you set. For example
    .bottom {
        width: auto;
        max-width: 600px;
    } 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    block: div, h1, p
    inline: big, i, small
    inline-block: button
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
    The box model is the sum of the CSS components that go into the style of an HTML item which includes the content, padding, border, and margin.  All of those collectively make up a box that goes around the HTML element's content. Not sure how to "fix" it as I am not sure that it's broken, but to get all elements to respect the width you've given them, I think you could use %s versus px to make elements a certain percentage of the screen size which would scale as the page changes. There also is a property, <box-sizing>, which seems to make CSS element sizing and scaling more responsive and intuitive.
